WebGL 3D WoW-ModelViewer

Attention!
Currently 3D Viewer is not yet fully completed - there's no saving character poses,
full screen mode and some other features.

To work correctly, you need to download an archive with the model textures (~300 MB compressed).

All files from archive must be unpacked to the 'models' folder. The unpacked files are approximately 465 megabytes.

Directory tree:
./models/
	/bgs
	/character
	/flash
	/images
	/item
		/objectcomponents
		/texturecomponents
		/spells
